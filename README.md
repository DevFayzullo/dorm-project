Online Dormitory Check-in/Check-out Management System for University Capstone Design Project.

This is a modern web-based application developed for a university capstone design competition. It allows students to easily check into or out of the dormitory, view available rooms, and manage their dormitory-related information online. The project emphasizes clean UI/UX, responsive design, and administrative tools.
